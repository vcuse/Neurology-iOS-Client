This mobile application works by using a centralized signaling server to facilitate the ability to video chat. It primarily relies on WebRTC. 
Additionally, the application supports iOS push notifications, as well as CallKit.

The goal of this application is to develop one iOS version that can then be ported over to an Apple Vision Pro VR headset
